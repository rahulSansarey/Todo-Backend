# Nodejs Boiler Plate code

I've created a Node.js boilerplate code and pushed it to GitHub. The purpose of this project is to provide a ready-to-use starting point for new Node.js projects. This way, when you begin a new project, you don't need to set everything up from scratch. You can simply clone the repository and start working immediately.

The boilerplate includes essential setup like database configuration, Express server initialization, and other necessary files to get you up and running quickly. This saves time and effort, allowing you to focus on building your application's features right from the start.
